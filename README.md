#### Explorations in Ƀitcoin :: decentralized trust networks :: the open blockchain

The purpose of this repo is to record my notes, summaries, thoughts, questions, and explorative research from **[Mastering Bitcoin 2nd Edition - Programming the Open Blockchain](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin-2nd/9781491954379/)**, by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. The official repository for the book is [https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook).

## Intro

**What it is:**
- collection of concepts and technologies that form the basis of a digital money ecosystem
- used to store and transmit value among participants in the bitcoin network
- users communicate with each other using the bitcoin protocol
- bitcoin protocol stack is open source
- it can be run on a wide range of computing devices

**How it's used:**  
- users transfer bitcoin over the network
- like fiat money they can buy and sell goods, send money to people or organizations, or extend credit
- it can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges
- near perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless

**Virtual by nature:**
- bitcoin are entirely virtual, so there's no physical coins or even digital coins
- coins are implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient
- users own keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the bitcoin network
- keys sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner
- keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user’s computer or smartphone
- possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only way to spend bitcoin
- this puts the control entirely in the hands of each user

**Distrubuted peer-to-peer system:**
- no “central” server or point of control
- Bitcoin are created through a process called “mining”
- involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing bitcoin transactions
- anyone can be a miner if they're using a device running the full bitcoin protocol staci
- they use their computer's processing power to verify and record transactions
- miners validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and are rewarded with a new bitcoin
- this process decentralizes the currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank
- it conveniently replaces the need for any central bank

**The protocol:**
- the included algorithms regulate mining function across network
- dynamic adjustment occurs during the mining process 
- this adjustment is the increase or decrease of difficulty of the processing task
- the intent for the adjustment is to make it so every 10 minutes, a miner succeeds
- by default, the protocol is also responsible for halving the rate at which new bitcoin are created
- it also limits the total number of bitcoin to be mined to just below 21 million coins
- this results in a predictable curve where the total bitcoin in circulation will max out in 2140
- as time goes on the currency becomes deflationary due to lower rate of issuance
- it cannot be inflated by printing new money

**The four key ingredients of Ƀitcoin:**
- decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)
- public transaction ledger (the blockchain)
- set of rules for independent transaction validation and currency issuance (consensus rules)
- tool for reaching global decentralized consensus on valid blockchain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)

**The history:**
- invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto
- comprised of several prior invenctions (b-money, HashCash)
- key innovation was using distributed computation system called "Proof of Work"
- solves the problem of double-spend by having global election every 10 minutes
- network officially started in 2009
- mining algorithm now exceeds combined processing power of world's top supercomputers
- Satoshi withdrew from public in 2011
- volunteers now run the project
- groundbreaking invention operating on mathematical prinicples, open source and consensus
- solves the Byzantine Generals' Problem using Proof-of-Work to acheive consensus
- total breakthrough in distributed computing
- can be widely applied beyond just currency
